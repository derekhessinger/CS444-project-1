    "## Task 5: Building deeper neural networks with blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quest to classify CIFAR-10 images with the highest accuracy possible, we would like to build a neural network that is deeper than VGG4 and has a greater capacity to learn more complex, nonlinear patterns in the images. Let's focus on designing a slightly deeper network than VGG4 that we will call VGG6 that has the following architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conv2D → Conv2D → MaxPool2D → **Conv2D → Conv2D → MaxPool2D** → Flatten → *Dense → Dropout* → Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the bold set of `Conv2D`/`MaxPool2D` layers are repeats of the layers to their left. It turns out, it may be beneficial to replicate the `Dense`/`Dropout` layers (italicized) toward the end of the network multiple times as well in deeper versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review your code for assembling `VGG4`. Building `VGG6` would require some copy-pasting of layer creation code. Imagine building even deeper versions with even more layers (e.g. `VGG9`) — this copy-paste process would get tedious, unwieldy, and potentially be error prone the bigger the network gets!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, modern deep neural networks are often built using **blocks**: sequences of layers that repeat over and over again as you get farther into the network. For example, imagine replacing the layers **Conv2D → Conv2D → MaxPool2D** with a SINGLE new object that represents performing that sequence of those 3 layers. If we also do this for the `Dense`/`Dropout` layers, the architecture would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "VGGConvBlock_0 → **VGGConvBlock_1** → Flatten → *VGGDenseBlock_0* → Dense\n",

    "#### 2. JIT compiling the train and test steps\n",
    "\n",
    "While training VGG6 on the GPU should take ~15 secs per epoch, which is not too bad, soon deeper networks and larger datasets will make the training too slow for us (*even on the GPU!*). To speed things up considerably now and going forward, use the process we discussed in class to decorate `train_step` and `test_step` with `@tf.function(jit_compile=True)`. The 1st epoch might be a little slow, but subsequent epochs should now fly by.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- If you have have trouble just-in-time (JIT) compiling the train and test steps, you should be able to decorate with `@tf.function` to statically compile the network (non-JIT). This may be slower than JIT compiling the network, but should still be faster than no compilation. **If JIT compiling does not work, please seek help. JIT compiling on CoCalc will be very helpful going forward.**\n",
